This Python code optimizes the production of chocolate and vanilla cakes to maximize profit using the `pulp` library for linear programming. Decision variables represent the quantities of cakes to produce, and the objective function aims to maximize profitâ€”$50 per chocolate cake and $40 per vanilla cake.

Two constraints are defined:
1. Flour availability: Producing 1 chocolate cake uses 2 units, and 1 vanilla cake uses 1 unit, with a total limit of 10 units.
2. Sugar availability: Each chocolate cake requires 1 unit of sugar and each vanilla cake requires 1.5 units, with a maximum of 8 units available.

The model computes the optimal number of each cake type to produce while staying within these constraints. It displays the solution status, the quantities of cakes to produce, and the resulting maximum profit, demonstrating an effective resource allocation model.
